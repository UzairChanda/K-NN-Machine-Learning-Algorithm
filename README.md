# K-NN-Machine-Learning-Algorithm
This is a simple machine learning project. This project will help to clear the basics of machine learing.
The k nearest neighbor(K-NN) is a simple , easy to implement supervised machine learning algorithm that can be used to solve both classification and regression problems.
A supervised machine learning algorithm is the one that relies on labelled input data to learn a function that produces an appropriate output when given new unlabelled data.
K-NN classifier refers to the number of nearest neighbors the classifier will retreive in order to make predictions.
Algorithm:-
Given a training set X_train and labels y_train, and given a new instance X_test to be classified.
1) Find the most similar instances to X_test that are in X_train.
2) Get the labels y_nn for the instances in X_nn
3) Perdict the label for X_test by combining the labels y_nn.
